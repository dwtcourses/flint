## Introduction

Flint is a low-code development platform based on kubernetes architecture and corresponding ecosystem in open-source community. 
It provides developers complete solution to build modern web applications for their complex business requirements in a visualized way with minimum coding efforts.

Advantages comparing with other commercial low-code solutions:

* **Single Page Application (SPA).** The applications built in Flint are react-based single page applications with dynamic UI and efficient rendering performance. 
Flint provides a serial of innovative functions in product to enable developers to build UI and frontend logic in a fast and comfortable way.
* **State-driven UI construction.** The UI construction method is model-driven based on the complete state management mechanism provided by React & Redux. 
Developers only need to design and update the state model to implement dynamic UI interactions.
* **DAG based workflow engine.** Any complex business logic could be defined in the DAG workflow engine with manual and parallel steps.
* **Source code generation.** 
* **Plugin Framework.**
* **Cloud native deployment solution.**

> Please note: current stage of Flint is still alpha and we are in rapid iterations to deliver features in the roadmap. The beta version is planned to be released by the end of this year. It is not recommended to use Flint in production before beta.
